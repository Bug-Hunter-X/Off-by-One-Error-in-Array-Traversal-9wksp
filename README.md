# Off-by-One Error in Java Array

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that arises when iterating over an array. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond the array's valid index range. This leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` during runtime.  The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code.

This is a simple yet impactful example to highlight the importance of careful array indexing in Java programming.
